        <h3>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone, I'm MuKonqi (Muhammed S.)!</p>
        <p>I have finished my 15th year, I'm finishing 16th year.</p>
        <p>I am a student in TÃ¼rkiye, I am in the 9th grade at Bursa Anatolian High School.</p>
        <p>I love developing simple projects (like this one), playing simulation and vehicle games.</p>
        <p>As for things which my favorites, my favorite color is <text style="color: #376296">#376296</text> and my favorite distribution is Fedora Linux.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in cars, buses, trucks and computers.</p>
        <p>By the way I know Python, CustomTkinter, Tkinter, HTML, CSS more or less.</p>
        <h3>The Past</h3>
        <p>I spent most of my childhood interested in cars, I love cars, but I'm not interested in them as much as I used to be.</p>
        <p>In early 2021, I signed up for the a technology-releated forum, which I will not name now and which I no longer use. I was already there for 3 months. In fact, at first I was more interested in phones than computers.<br>
            When my 10-year-old laptop started having problems, I started looking for other operating systems. That's when I discovered GNU/Linux distributions.<br>
            I installed Linux Mint Xfce, the first distro I used, on February 24, 2021. But I wanted to sail in this sea, so I became a distrohopper.<br>
            The distros I have tried in my distrohopper process, although I am not sure: Linux Mint, Debian GNU/Linux, Devuan, Ubuntu, Ubuntu Mate, Kubuntu, Ubuntu DDE, KDE neon, elementary OS, Pop!_OS, Zorin OS, Pardus, Arch Linux, EndeavourOS, Manjaro, Fedora Linux, OpenSUSE, Gentoo, Solus, Pisi Linux<br>
            On March 6, 2021, I tried Terminalden kurtulun by Ramkafasi. I felt like doing something similar, so I developed BetterXP based on it.<br>
            In 2022 I played more games and increased the number of my projects.<br>
            But the bad thing about 2021-2022 was that I was a GNU fanboy... I had read on the GNU page that it was wrong to call Linux GNU/Linux, and it affected me a lot. This fanboyism lasted for a long time.<br>
            I also opened my Steam account, first bought ETS2, then my library grew and grew, and after switching to Steam dollars I bought generic games from Epic Games (which has the worst launcher I've ever seen).</p>
        <p>The year 2023 was a bit too empty in terms of projects due to the LGS exam, the biggest advances were MetterXP v3.0 version and this site. I was playing games when I had time from classes.</p>
        In 2024, one of my projects will be <a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/grelintb" style="color: #376296">GrelinTB</a>, which I coded in Python3 and used the CustomTkinter library. I also plan to learn other programming languages.
