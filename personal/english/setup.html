            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone, I'm MuKonqi (Muhammed S.)!</p>
            <p>I finished my 15th year, I'm finishing my 16th year at the moment.</p>
            <p>I am a student in TÃ¼rkiye, I am in the 9th grade at Bursa Anatolian High School.</p>
            <p>I love developing simple projects (like this one and GrelinTB), playing computer video games.</p>
            <p>As for things which my favorites, my favorite color is <text style="color: #376296">#376296</text>, my favorite distribution is Fedora Linux and my favorite DE is KDE Plasma 6.</p>
            <p>I'm interested in cars, buses, trucks and computers.</p>
            <p>By the way I know Python, CustomTkinter, Tkinter, HTML, CSS, JS more or less.</p>
            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <p>I spent most of my childhood interested in cars, I love cars, but I'm not interested in them as much as I used to be.</p>
            <h2>2021</h2>
            <p>First, I signed up for a technology-releated forums, which I no longer use. I didn't stay there so lang. In fact, at first I was more interested in phones than computers.<br>
                When my 10-year-old laptop started having problems, I started looking for other operating systems. That's when I discovered GNU/Linux distributions.<br>
                I installed Linux Mint Xfce, the first distro I used, on February 24, 2021. But I wanted to sail in this sea, so I became a distrohopper.<br>
                The distros I have tried in my distrohopper process, although I am not sure:
                <li>Linux Mint</li>
                <li>Debian GNU/Linux</li>
                <li>Devuan</li>
                <li>Ubuntu</li>
                <li>Ubuntu Mate</li>
                <li>Kubuntu</li>
                <li>Ubuntu DDE</li>
                <li>KDE neon</li>
                <li>elementary OS</li>
                <li>Pop!_OS</li>
                <li>Zorin OS</li>
                <li>Pardus</li>
                <li>Arch Linux</li>
                <li>EndeavourOS</li>
                <li>Manjaro</li>
                <li>Fedora Linux</li>
                <li>OpenSUSE</li>
                <li>Gentoo</li>
                <li>Solus</li>
                <li>Pisi Linux</li><br>
                On March 6, 2021, I tried Terminalden kurtulun. I felt like doing something similar, so I developed BetterXP based on it. BetterXP removes the logo of Terminalden kurtulun in main page and brings Fedora Linux and Solus support with forced dark mode. BetterXP based MetterXP brings optimations and some improvements.<br></p>
            <h2>2022</h2>
            <p>In 2022 I played so much computer video games and increased the number of my projects.<br>
                But the bad thing about 2021-2022 was that I was a GNU fanboy... I had read on the GNU page that it was wrong to call Linux GNU/Linux, and it affected me a lot. This fanboyism lasted for a long time.<br>
                I also opened my Steam account, first bought ETS2, then my library grew and grew. When Steam dropped TL in Turkey, I bought games of various genres from Epic Games (which by the way has the worst launcher).</p>
            <h2>2023</h2>
                <p>It was a bit too empty in terms of projects due to the LGS exam, the biggest advances were MetterXP v3.0 version and this site. I was playing games when I had time from classes.</p>
            <h2>2024</h2>
            <p>This year, one of my projects is <a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/grelintb" style="color: #376296">GrelinTB</a>, which I coded in Python3 and used the CustomTkinter library. I also plan to learn other programming languages.<br>For gaming, <div style="text-decoration: line-through;">I'm hoping I can finish Ultrakill :D</div> I finished it finally! If I'm serious, I mean, I don't have very special goals, continue normal life :)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="button" onclick="show_projects()">Projects</div>
        <div id="projects" class="page" style="display: none;">
        <div class="project"><div class="title"><a href="/grelintb/index.html" id="normal"><h3>GrelinTB</h3></a></div>
        <p>I coded the first version when I had time during a 16-day vacation in 2024. Because default Tkinter was looking really bad also I was bored and wanted to learn something new.<br>
            So GrelinTB was born, I really like <a href="https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter/">CustomTkinter</a> and I also realized the power of object oriented programming.<br>
            Since I code object-oriented, everything except the changelogs and the license is in the whole window. It looks much more beautiful.<br>
            Until v1.2.0.0 there were 2 disadvantages compared to MetterXP, one was fixed with v1.2.0.0. The other one was fixed with v1.3.0.0. Finally there are no disadvantages compared to MetterXP.</p></div>
        <div class="project"><div class="title"><a href="https://mukonqi.github.io" id="normal"><h3>mukonqi.github.io</h3></a></div>
        <p>In 2021 there was no CSS, it was just plain HTML. Then, as I gradually learned CSS (I still learned it more fully), it became like this. Now I also started using JS.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Main Page: A selection of important pages hosted here.</li>
            <li>Personal: A place where you can learn about me, read my comments about my projects and look at my setup.</li>
            <li>Blog: A blog place where I will not be active (may be).</li>

        </ul></div>    
        <div class="project"><div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/mukotes" id="archived"><h3>Mukotes (archived)</h3></a></div>
        <p>This is a very basic notes editor, but GrelinTB's notes feature is much better.</p>   </div>        
        <div class="project"><div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/mukander" id="archived"><h3>Mukander (archived)</h3></a></div>
        <p>The purpose is to launch commands. It can start with sudo if the user wants. Obviously it can never be a terminal as it is.</p></div>
        <div class="project"><div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/muktart" id="archived"><h3>Muktart (archived)</h3></a></div>
        <p>What Muktart did: run ls to see the items of the /usr/share/applications folder, then list the applications and start them either normally or with sudo. Well, it's unnecessary since there is such a thing as a start menu.</p></div>            
        <div class="project"><div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/projgit" id="archived"><h3>Projgit (archived)</h3></a></div>
        <p>I did it to make easier to publish changes to Git repositories, but these days I publish changes to VS Code's extension :D So I don't even use it.</p> </div>
        <div class="project"><div class="title"><a href="https:/github.com/mukonqi/peytehow" id="archived"><h3>Peytehow (archived)</h3></a></div>
        <p>How to make an interfaced program with Python and Tkinter?<br>It's purpose is really just that but it doesn't even have some basic features.</p> </div>
        <div class="project"><div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/apiutaller" id="archived"><h3>Apiutaller (archived)</h3></a></div>
        <p>Both BetterXP and MetterXP had their own installers but I made Apiutaller to be generic. It worked for a while, but it was too bloated for me, so I didn't use it in GrelinTB and made a bash script myself.</p></div>
        <div class="project"><div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/yasfetch" id="archived"><h3>Yasfetch (archived)</h3></a></div>
        <p>It works very, very slowly. There are very good alternatives.</p></div>
        <div class="project"><div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/teaf" id="archived"><h3>TEAf (archived)</h3></a></div>
        <p>I just wanted to show that Apiutaller works well, and it works, but it was just that, it's not really necessary.</p></div>
        <div class="project"><div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/metterxp" id="stopped"><h3>MetterXP (stopped)</h3></a></div>
        <p>My former "big" project, but I stopped it because the interface and the code were too complicated, the code was not coded well at all, so I started a new project from scratch: <a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/grelintb">GrelinTB</a></p></div>
        <div class="project"><div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/metterxp/tree/betterxp" id="stopped"><h3>BetterXP (stopped)</h3></a></div>
        <p>I started developing the BetterXP project based on Terminalden kurtulun. This came out with removing the logo from the Terminalden kurtulun homepage. The improvements included support for Fedora Linux and Solus. I also changed the colors in version 2 and that was it.</p></div>
        <div class="project"><div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/betterss" id="stopped"><h3>BetterSS (stopped)</h3></a></div>
        <p>It was my second project, but it was discontinued because I did not find it very useful. All it did was run the Flameshot program.</p></div>
        <div class="project"><div class="title" id="removed"><h3>ASLA (removed)</h3></div>
        <p>Not to mention, the result of unnecessary boredom.</p></div>
        <div class="project"><div class="title" id="removed"><h3>MetterXP's and BetterXP's web sites (removed)</h3></div>
        <p>As they both grew and became more complex I felt the need to make a site but with v3.0 I added a wiki.</p></div>
        <div class="project"><div class="title" id="removed"><h3>newtab (removed)</h3></div>
        <p>Just new tab page. It wasn't as useful as a browsers' new tab, so I removed it.</p></div>
        </div>
