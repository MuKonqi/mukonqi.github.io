            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>Hello everyone, I'm MuKonqi (Muhammed S.)!</p>
            <p>I finished my 15th year, I'm finishing my 16th year in the world at the moment.</p>
            <p>I am a student in Türkiye, I am in the 10th grade at Bursa Anatolian High School.</p>
            <p>I love developing simple projects (like this website, Nottodbox and GrelinTB), playing computer video games.</p>
            <p>As for things which my favorites, my favorite color is <span style="color: #376296">#376296</span>, my favorite distribution is opensuse Tumbleweed and my favorite DE is KDE Plasma 6.</p>
            <p>I'm interested in vehicles and technology.</p>
            <p>By the way I know Python, Qt, CustomTkinter, Tkinter, HTML, CSS, JS more or less.</p>
            
            <h1>Childhood</h1>
            <p>When I was a kid, my main hobby was cars, but now I'm not as interested as I used to be.</p>
            
            <h1>2020</h1>
            <p>When my parents gave me my first smartphone (Samsung Galaxy M31), I was tinkering with it and I noticed application called Samsung Members. I opened an account there. That's actually how my forum life started. I don't use that forum anymore.
                <br>Also, of course I was at home when Covid-19 started. Things like making imaginary cars from wood helped me not to get bored. Of course, classes also had an effect on this.</p>
            
            <h1>2021</h1>
            <p>I signed up for a general technology-releated forum, but I didn't stay there very long. I don't use that forum anymore.
                <br>When my 10-year-old laptop started having problems, I started looking for other operating systems. That's when I discovered GNU/Linux distributions.
                <br>I installed Linux Mint Xfce, the first distro I used, on February 24, 2021. But I wanted to sail in this sea, so I became a distrohopper.
                <br>The distros I have tried in my distrohopper process, although I am not sure:</p>
                <li>Linux Mint</li>
                <li>Debian GNU/Linux</li>
                <li>Devuan</li>
                <li>Ubuntu</li>
                <li>Ubuntu Mate</li>
                <li>Kubuntu</li>
                <li>Ubuntu DDE</li>
                <li>KDE neon</li>
                <li>elementary OS</li>
                <li>Pop!_OS</li>
                <li>Zorin OS</li>
                <li>Pardus</li>
                <li>Arch Linux</li>
                <li>EndeavourOS</li>
                <li>Manjaro</li>
                <li>Fedora Linux</li>
                <li>openSUSE</li>
                <li>Gentoo</li>
                <li>Solus</li>
                <li>Pisi Linux</li><br>
                <p>On March 6, 2021, I tried Terminalden kurtulun. I felt like doing something similar, so I developed BetterXP based on it. BetterXP removes the logo of Terminalden kurtulun in main page and brings Fedora Linux and Solus support with forced dark mode. BetterXP based MetterXP brings optimations and some improvements.
                    <br>I also started using Steam for the first time, and the reason I used Steam was because I started ETS2.</p>
            
            <h1>2022</h1>
            <p>In 2022 I played so much computer video games and increased the number of my projects.
                <br>But the bad thing about 2021-2022 was that I was a GNU fanboy... I had read on the GNU page that it was wrong to call Linux GNU/Linux, and it affected me a lot. This fanboyism lasted for a long time.
                <br>My Steam library also continued to grow.</p>
            
            <h1>2023</h1>
            <p>It was a bit too empty in terms of projects due to the LGS exam, the biggest advances were MetterXP v3.0 version and this site. I played video games when I had time from classes.
                <br>I also bought some games on Epic Games because Steam dropped the TL. And I got one of my dreams: Thrustmaster T300 RS GT with TH8S</p>
            
            <h1>2024-2025</h1>
            <p>My biggest goal this year is to release a stable version of <a href=“https://github.com/mukonqi/nottodbox”>Nottodbox</a>.
                <br>As for entertainment, I finished ULTRAKILL and started Star Trucker as new games.
                <br>In general, of course, continue to live normally :)</p>
