            <p>During the 16 days of vacation I started coding, Tkinter was looking very bad, I was bored and I wanted to learn something new.<br>
                So GrelinTB was born, I really liked <a href="https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter/">CustomTkinter</a> and I also realized the power of object oriented programming.</p>

            <p><a href="/archive/photos/v5.png" target="_blank" style="color: #376296">New frame style and new texts. (screenshot has Wayback Machine bug)</a></p>
            <p><a href="/archive/photos/v6.png" target="_blank" style="color: #376296">I can call it's my comrade in the LGS process. Very similar to previous version.</a></p>
            <p><a href="/archive/v7/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: #376296">Just like the version you see now, I made it out of boredom and a desire for change. But now it seems strange that it didn't last long.</a></p>
            <p><text style="color: #376296">It is extremely similar to this version. The differences with this version are the colors and documentation style.</text></p>
            <p><a href="/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: #376296">This version. The mix of beauty and practicality is now everywhere.</a></p>
            <p><a href="/archive/photos/afacanc38's-jekyll-theme.png" target="_blank" style="color: #376296">I didn't contribute anything to his theme, I just changed the texts to suit myself, that's all.</a></p>            
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/mukotes" id="normal"><h3>Mukotes</h3></a></div>
            <p>It is a very basic note editor. It can create, delete and edit notes.</p>
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/apiutaller" id="normal"><h3>Apiutaller</h3></a></div>
            <p>Both BetterXP and MetterXP had their own installers (not wizard), but I wanted to make a global installer wizard, so I released the Apiutaller wizard. Apiutaller also made my own work easier in many of my subsequent projects.
                <br>With v2.0, Apiutaller got rid of childish and unnecessary sympathetic expressions. Also reinstallation feature added. For all the changes: <a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/apiutaller/releases/tag/v2.0">Click here.</a></p>     
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/mukander" id="normal"><h3>Mukander</h3></a></div>
            <p>The purpose is to launch commands. It can start with sudo if the user wants. Obviously it can never be a terminal as it is.</p>
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/muktart" id="normal"><h3>Muktart</h3></a></div>
            <p>What Muktart did: Run ls command for looking /usr/share/applications directory's items later lists the applications and launches them on user's demand (normally or with sudo). By the way, people start applications like this before start menu was invented (!).</p>            
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/projgit" id="normal"><h3>Projgit</h3></a></div>
            <p>I did it to make it easier to publish changes to Git repositories, but nowadays I publish changes with VS Codium's extension. :D</p> 
            <div class="title"><a href="https:/github.com/mukonqi/peytehow" id="normal"><h3>Peytehow</h3></a></div>
            <p>How to make a GUI program with Python and Tkinter<br>It's purpose was really just that.</p> 
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/yasfetch" id="normal"><h3>Yasfetch</h3></a></div>
            <p>Yet Another Fetch<br>As the name suggests, it's yet another information retrieval app. By the way, I myself admit that it is not as detailed and fast as a Neofetch. :D</p>        
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/teaf" id="normal"><h3>TEAf</h3></a></div>
            <p>The Example App for<br>I just wanted to show that Apiutaller works good.</p>
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/asla" id="normal"><h3>ASLA</h3></a></div>
            <p>I coded most of it on the school's smart board and made the final touches at home. I did it out of sheer boredom. :D</p>
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/metterxp" id="stopped"><h3>MetterXP (stopped)</h3></a></div>
                <p>My former "big" project, but I stopped it because the interface and the code were too complicated, the code was not coded well at all, so I started a new project from scratch: <a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/grelintb">GrelinTB</a>
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/metterxp/tree/betterxp" id="stopped"><h3>BetterXP (stopped)</h3></a></div>
            <p>I started to build <a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/metterxp/tree/betterxp">BetterXP</a> based on Terminalden kurtulun. This was both out of curiosity and to remove the logo from the home page of the Terminalden kurtulun project. The first BetterXP releases contained my own improvements. But in the later versions under 1.x I added new support to those improvements, namely Fedora Linux and Solus support. One of the reasons for adding support was that I was a distrohopper at the time. 
                <br>After that, 2.0 came out and that was short-lived. I changed the colors there and I made some improvements for GUI. And finally it died because the code was very, very complicated.</p>
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/betterss" id="stopped"><h3>BetterSS (stopped)</h3></a></div>
            <p>It was my second project, but it was discontinued because I did not find it very useful. All it did was run the Flameshot program.</p>
            <div class="title" id="stopped"><h3>My Personal Blog (removed)</h3></div>
            <p>When I started using a theme that supports blogging (I'm not sure but I think it was <a href="https://github.com/Afacanc38" target="_blank" style="color: #376296">Afacanc38</a>'s theme) I wrote a few blogs, but then I removed the blogs because I don't want to blog anymore, I don't have time to blog and sometimes I had problems with Jekyll.</p>
            <div class="title" id="stopped"><h3>MetterXP's and BetterXP's web sites (removed)</h3></div>
            <p>As they both got bigger and more sophisticated I felt the urge to make a site, but when I added the wiki with v3.0 that feeling disappeared. In addition, MetterXP is now very simple and easy to run.</p>
            <div class="title" id="stopped"><h3>newtab (removed)</h3></div>
            <p>Just new tab page. It wasn't as useful as a browsers' new tab, so I removed it.</p>
