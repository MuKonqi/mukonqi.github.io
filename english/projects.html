            <p>I coded the first version when I had time during a 16-day vacation. Because default Tkinter was looking really bad also I was bored and wanted to learn something new.<br>
                So GrelinTB was born, I really like <a href="https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter/">CustomTkinter</a> and I also realized the power of object oriented programming.<br>
                Since I code object-oriented, everything except the changelogs and the license is in the whole window. It looks much more beautiful.<br>
                Until v1.2.0.0 there were 2 disadvantages compared to MetterXP, one was fixed with v1.2.0.0. The other one was fixed with v1.3.0.0. Finally there are no disadvantages compared to MetterXP.</p>

            <li><a href="/archive/v1/index.html" target="_blank">No style. Just title average.</a></li>
            <li><a href="/archive/photos/v2.png" target="_blank">Background color was added.</a></li>
            <li><a href="/archive/photos/v3.png" target="_blank">Box in the box.</a></li>
            <li><a href="/archive/photos/v4.png" target="_blank">Frame and new texts time. (screenshot has Wayback Machine bug)</a></li>
            <li><a href="/archive/photos/v5.png" target="_blank">New frame style and new texts. (screenshot has Wayback Machine bug)</a></li>
            <li><a href="/archive/photos/v6.png" target="_blank">I can call it's my comrade in the LGS process. Very similar to previous version.</a></li>
            <li><a href="/archive/v7/index.html" target="_blank">Just like the version you see now, I made it out of boredom and a desire for change. But now it seems strange that it didn't last long.</a></li>
            <li><text>It is extremely similar to this version. The differences with this version are the colors and documentation style.</text></li>
            <li><a href="/index.html" target="_blank">This version. The mix of beauty and practicality is now everywhere.</a></li>
            <li><a href="/archive/photos/afacanc38's-jekyll-theme.png" target="_blank">I didn't contribute anything to his theme, I just changed the texts to suit myself, that's all.</a></li>            
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/mukotes" id="archived"><h3>Mukotes (archived)</h3></a></div>
            <p>This is a very basic notes editor, but GrelinTB's notes feature is much better.</p>           
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/mukander" id="archived"><h3>Mukander (archived)</h3></a></div>
            <p>The purpose is to launch commands. It can start with sudo if the user wants. Obviously it can never be a terminal as it is.</p>
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/muktart" id="archived"><h3>Muktart (archived)</h3></a></div>
            <p>What Muktart did: run ls to see the items of the /usr/share/applications folder, then list the applications and start them either normally or with sudo. Well, it's unnecessary since there is such a thing as a start menu.</p>            
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/projgit" id="archived"><h3>Projgit (archived)</h3></a></div>
            <p>I did this to make it easier to publish changes to Git repositories, but these days I publish changes to VS Codium's extension :D So I don't even use it.</p> 
            <div class="title"><a href="https:/github.com/mukonqi/peytehow" id="archived"><h3>Peytehow (archived)</h3></a></div>
            <p>How to make an interfaced program with Python and Tkinter?<br>It's purpose is really just that but it doesn't really deliver, the application doesn't even have some basic features.</p> 
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/apiutaller" id="archived"><h3>Apiutaller (archived)</h3></a></div>
            <p>Both BetterXP and MetterXP had their own installers but I made Apiutaller to be generic. It worked for a while, but it was too bloated for me, so I didn't use it in GrelinTB and made a bash script myself.</p>
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/yasfetch" id="archived"><h3>Yasfetch (archived)</h3></a></div>
            <p>It works very, very slowly. There are very good alternatives.</p>        
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/teaf" id="archived"><h3>TEAf (archived)</h3></a></div>
            <p>I just wanted to show that Apiutaller works well, and it works, but it was just that, it's not really necessary.</p>
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/asla" id="archived"><h3>ASLA (archived)</h3></a></div>
            <p>I coded most of it on the school's smart board and made the final touches at home. My purpose of doing it was pure boredom :D Since the project is over, there is no reason why it should not be in the archive, it was already a fun project.</p>
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/metterxp" id="stopped"><h3>MetterXP (stopped)</h3></a></div>
            <p>My former "big" project, but I stopped it because the interface and the code were too complicated, the code was not coded well at all, so I started a new project from scratch: <a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/grelintb">GrelinTB</a></p>
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/metterxp/tree/betterxp" id="stopped"><h3>BetterXP (stopped)</h3></a></div>
            <p>I started developing the <a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/metterxp/tree/betterxp">BetterXP</a> project based on Get rid of Terminal. This came out of curiosity and removing the logo from the Terminalden kurtulun homepage. The improvements included support for Fedora Linux and Solus. I also played with the colors with v2 and that was it.</p>
            <div class="title"><a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/betterss" id="stopped"><h3>BetterSS (stopped)</h3></a></div>
            <p>It was my second project, but it was discontinued because I did not find it very useful. All it did was run the Flameshot program.</p>
            <div class="title" id="removed"><h3>My Personal Blog (removed)</h3></div>
            <p>When I started using a theme that supports blogging (I'm not sure but I think it was <a href="https://github.com/Afacanc38" target="_blank">Afacanc38</a>'s theme) I wrote a few blogs, but then I removed the blogs because I don't want to blog anymore, I don't have time to blog and sometimes I had problems with Jekyll. Maybe in the future I can make my own blog theme just for fun...</p>
            <div class="title" id="removed"><h3>MetterXP's and BetterXP's web sites (removed)</h3></div>
            <p>As they both grew and became more complex I felt the need to make a site but with v3.0 I added a wiki.</p>
            <div class="title" id="removed"><h3>newtab (removed)</h3></div>
            <p>Just new tab page. It wasn't as useful as a browsers' new tab, so I removed it.</p>
