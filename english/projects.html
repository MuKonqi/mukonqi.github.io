        <div class="text">I started studying here from September 11 2023 and if there are no problems, I'll graduate in 2027. I entered this high school with an LGS score of 483,20 out of 500 and the minimum score to enter here was 481,6389. While my percentile was 0,90 in Turkiye in general, it was 0,88 in Bursa in general.</div>

            <div class="title"><h3>BetterXP (discontinued)</h3></div>
            <p>I started to build <a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/metterxp/tree/betterxp">BetterXP</a> based on Terminalden kurtulun. This was both out of curiosity and to remove the logo from the home page of the Terminalden kurtulun project. The first BetterXP releases contained my own improvements. But in the later versions under 1.x I added new support to those improvements, namely Fedora Linux and Solus support. One of the reasons for adding support was that I was a distrohopper at the time. 
                <br>After that, 2.0 came out and that was short-lived. I changed the colors there and I made some improvements for GUI. And finally it died because the code was very, very complicated and I wanted a better name. BetterXP was for better, MetterXP is for maximum.</p>
            <div class="title"><h3>BetterSS (stopped)</h3></div>
            <p>It was my second project, but it was discontinued because I did not find it very useful. All it did was run the Flameshot program.</p>
            <div class="title"><h3>Peytehow</h3></div>
            <p>How to make a GUI program with Python and Tkinter<br>It's purpose was really just that.</p><br><br>

            <p>My best project thanks v3.0. To talk about advenced tools:
                <ul>
                    <li>Application store</li>
                    <li>Desktop Environment and Windows Manager store</li>

                                    <li>Basic color themes</li>
                                    <li>People's themes</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>And more!</li>
                </ul>
                <br>The most important innovation of v1.0 was actually for me: The module system. In this way, each module had its own module and this made it very easy for me to make new updates.
                <br>The biggest advantages of version v2.0 were the theme system and the addition of English language. But the biggest disadvantage of this theme system was that the settings were stored in the /usr/local/bin/metterxp/settings folder. So only 1 setting on a computer, if there were 2 users they had to use it together.
                <br>With version 3.0, the information is now stored in the /home/username/.by-mukonqi/metterxp/ folder. This means happiness and now everyone can enjoy their own taste and their own language! Also for all the innovations: <a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/metterxp/releases/tag/v3.0">Click here.</a></p><br><br>
            <div class="title"><h3>Apiutaller</h3></div>
            <p>Both BetterXP and MetterXP had their own installers (not wizard), but I wanted to make a global installer wizard, so I released the Apiutaller wizard. Apiutaller also made my own work easier in many of my subsequent projects.
                <br>With v2.0, Apiutaller got rid of childish and unnecessary sympathetic expressions. Also reinstallation feature added. For all the changes: <a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/apiutaller/releases/tag/v2.0">Click here.</a></p>
            <div class="title"><h3>TEAf</h3></div>
            <p>The Example App for<br>I just wanted to show that Apiutaller works good.</p>
            <div class="title"><h3>yasfetch</h3></div>
            <p>Yet Another Fetch<br>As the name suggests, it's yet another information retrieval app. By the way, I myself admit that it is not as detailed and fast as a Neofetch. :D</p>
            <div class="title"><h3>Projgit</h3></div>
            <p>I did it to make it easier to publish changes to Git repositories, but nowadays I publish changes with VS Code's tool. :D</p>
            <div class="title"><h3>Mukander, Mukotes, Muktart (<a href="https://github.com/MuKonqi/mukotes">Mukotes</a> is my favorite)</h3></div>
            <p>The purpose of the Mukander project is to launch commands. It can start with sudo if the user wants. Obviously it can never be a terminal as it is.</p>
            <p>Of these three, this is the one that really works for me. It can create, delete and edit notes. That's enough for me.</p>
            <p>What Muktart did: Run ls command for looking /usr/share/applications directory's items later lists the applications and launches them on user's demand (normally or with sudo).<br>By the way, people start applications like this before start menu was invented (!).</p>
            <br><br><br>

            <p>Note: Some versions can be missing. You can click on the colored texts below for previews.</p>
            <p><a href="/media/v1/index.html" target="_blank">No style. Just title average.</a></p>
            <p><a href="/media/photos/v2.png" target="_blank" style="color: yellow;">Background color was added.</a></p>
            <p><a href="/media/photos/v3.png" target="_blank" style="color: yellow;">Box in the box.</a></p>
            <p><a href="/media/photos/v4.png" target="_blank" style="color: yellow;">Frame and new texts time. (screenshot has Wayback Machine bug)</a></p>
            <p><a href="/media/photos/v5.png" target="_blank" style="color: yellow;">New frame style and new texts. (screenshot has Wayback Machine bug)</a></p>
            <p><a href="/media/photos/v6.png" target="_blank" style="color: yellow;">I can call it's my comrade in the LGS process. Very similar to previous version.</a></p>
            <p><a href="/media/v7/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: #a9a9a9;">Just like the version you see now, I made it out of boredom and a desire for change. But now it seems strange that it didn't last long.</a></p>
            <p><a href="/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: #2f2f2f;">This version. Now buttons, simplicity, useful and beauty are everywhere.</a></p>
            <p><a href="/media/photos/afacanc38's-jekyll-theme.png" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(61,56,70);">I didn't contribute anything to his theme, I just changed the texts to suit myself, that's all.</a></p>
            <div class="title"><h3>My Personal Blog (removed)</h3></div>
            <p>When I started using a theme that supports blogging (I'm not sure but I think it was <a href="https://github.com/Afacanc38" target="_blank">Afacanc38</a>'s theme) I wrote a few blogs, but then I removed the blogs because I don't want to blog anymore, I don't have time to blog and sometimes I had problems with Jekyll.</p>
            <div class="title"><h3>MetterXP's and BetterXP's web sites (removed)</h3></div>
            <p>As they both got bigger and more sophisticated I felt the urge to make a site, but when I added the wiki with v3.0 that feeling disappeared. In addition, MetterXP is now very simple and easy to run.</p>
            <div class="title"><h3>newtab (removed)</h3></div>
            <p>Just new tab page. It wasn't as useful as a browsers' new tab, so I removed it.</p>
