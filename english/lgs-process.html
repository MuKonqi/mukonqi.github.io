        <div class="text">I started studying here from September 11 2023 and if there are no problems, I'll graduate in 2027. I entered this high school with an LGS score of 483,20 out of 500 and the minimum score to enter here was 481,6389. While my percentile was 0,90 in Turkiye in general, it was 0,88 in Bursa in general.</div>

        <div class="description">
            <p>I enrolled in a course for LGS in the 2rd quarter of 2022 and I didn't study until September 2022 when I don't study in full LGS format because I was only in 7th grade then.</p>
            <p>When we came to September 2022, that was the time for serious study. At first, I was solving 1200-1400 questions with great enthusiasm, but the books I solved were not very new generation. After that, my question count started to drop as time went on, but I never stopped solving questions except for important exceptions. After the first times, my question count was between 700 and 900 (usually it was closer to 700 :D) but I was solving more new generation style books. In the last weeks, I started solving essays and that's when the real boredom started. I was really fed up then.</p>
            <p>As for the result, it was a very good result. At first, of course thanks to my family. Thanks to all my teachers in this process. Thanks to my 2 friends at school and my group of friends in the course.</p>
