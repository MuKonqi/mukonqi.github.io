            <p>I spent most of my childhood interested in cars, I love cars, but I'm not interested in them as much as I used to be.</p>
            <p>In early 2021, I signed up for the "technology" forum, which I will not name now and which I no longer use. I was already there for 3 months. In fact, at first I was more interested in phones than computers.<br>
                When my 10-year-old laptop started having problems, I started looking for other operating systems. That's when I discovered GNU/Linux distributions.<br>
                I installed Linux Mint Xfce, the first distro I used, on February 24, 2021. But I wanted to sail in this sea, so I became a distrohopper.<br>
                The distros I have tried in my distrohopper process, although I am not sure:
                <ul>
                    <li>Linux Mint</li>
                    <li>Debian GNU/Linux</li>
                    <li>Devuan</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu Mate</li>
                    <li>Kubuntu</li>
                    <li>Ubuntu DDE</li>
                    <li>KDE neon</li>
                    <li>elementary OS</li>
                    <li>Pop!_OS</li>
                    <li>Zorin OS</li>
                    <li>Pardus</li>
                    <li>Arch Linux</li>
                    <li>EndeavourOS</li>
                    <li>Manjaro</li>
                    <li>Fedora Linux</li>
                    <li>OpenSUSE</li>
                    <li>Gentoo</li>
                    <li>Solus</li>
                    <li>Pisi Linux</li>
                </ul><br>
                On March 6, 2021, I tried Terminalden kurtulun by Ramkafasi. I felt like doing something similar, so I developed BetterXP based on it.<br>
                In 2022 I played more games and increased the number of my projects.<br>
                But the bad thing about 2021-2022 was that I was a GNU fanboy... I had read on the GNU page that it was wrong to call Linux GNU/Linux, and it affected me a lot. This fanboyism lasted for a long time.<br>
                I also opened my Steam account, first bought ETS2, then my library grew and grew, and after switching to Steam dollars I bought generic games from Epic Games (which has the worst launcher I've ever seen).</p>
            <p>The year 2023 was a bit too empty in terms of projects due to the LGS exam, the biggest advances were MetterXP v3.0 version and this site. I was playing games when I had time from classes.</p>
            <p>In 2024, my main project will be <a href="https://github.com/mukonqi/grelintb" style="color: #376296">GrelinTB</a> using the CustomTkinter library, I plan to release it soon. I also plan to learn languages like C++ and C#.</p>
